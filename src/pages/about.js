    `Hello,
I'm Mujahid Ahmed, a Computer Science student (B.E.)
Currently I'm in the fourth year.
I primarily focus on ML and AI, but being a generalist,
I have explored other areas like Web/App Development,
Blockchain, etc. as well. Being a Dev doesn't hurt after all.

I believe that the hard problem of science,
i.e, 'Consciousness',
is possibly in the domain of computation,
and that understanding it requires
understanding 'Intelligence' first.
It motivates me to find more and more about
Neuromorphic Computing, Deep Learning & AI.

Besides that I love some other gigs like
visual arts, sound engineering and more.

You can check out my YouTube channel and Medium page.
